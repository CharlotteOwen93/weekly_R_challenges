# Background
# For the purpose of this challenge, the 12 musical notes in the chromatic scale are named:
# 	
# 	C  C#  D  D#  E  F  F#  G  G#  A  A#  B
# The interval between each pair of notes is called a semitone, and the sequence wraps around. So for instance, E is 1 semitone above D#, C is 1 semitone above B, F# is 4 semitones above D, and C# is 10 semitones above D#. (This also means that every note is 12 semitones above itself.)
# 
# A major scale comprises 7 out of the 12 notes in the chromatic scale. There are 12 different major scales, one for each note. For instance, the D major scale comprises these 7 notes:
# 	
# 	D  E  F#  G  A  B  C#
# The notes in a major scale are the notes that are 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 11 semitones above the note that the scale is named after. In the movable do solf√®ge system, these are referred to by the names Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, and Ti, respectively. So for instance, Mi in the D major scale is F#, because F# is 4 semitones above D.
